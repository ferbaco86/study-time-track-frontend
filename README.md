# Study-Time-Track-App: Frontend

> Study Time Track App Frontend is a web app built with React, which connects to the [Study-Time-Track-Backend](https://github.com/ferbaco86/study-time-track-frontend).
> The app allows the user to register the time he/she spends on a given task. 


## Main Features

* It allows the users to register and log in using a username and password.

* Authorization managed with JWT token so the user session persists. 

* The user can create a study session and add study subjects and the time she/he spent studying it to that particular session.

* The user can check his sessions page and see the list of study sessions she/he created.

* The user can access the session detail and see all the subjects studied in that session and the corresponding time.

* The user can get the latest and longest sessions, and top 5 most studied subjects in the progress page.
